## Project Description
The project begins with an initial sentiment classification of the test data using pre-trained models from libraries such as TextBlob, Vader Sentiment, and Stanza. After preprocessing tasks aimed at improving the analysis of supervised machine learning classifiers, models like Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression show promising results with TF-IDF vector representation. Significant gains have been achieved using the Transformer-XL model, optimized for handling long data sequences.

### Key Features
- Utilization of pre-trained sentiment analysis tools (TextBlob, Vader Sentiment, Stanza).
- Advanced text preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stop words removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Implementation of machine learning models including SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression.
- Application of Transformer models like Transformer-XL and generative model GPT-3.5 Turbo for enhanced sentiment classification.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project comprises 48,902 training reviews and 2,417 testing reviews from Amazon, categorized into 'positive' or 'negative' sentiment.
